                    <span class="first-character">T</span> oucans are best known for their large, colorful bills, which can be four times the size of their 
                    head. They use their beak to reach food far out on branches or deep into tree cavities. Finding and catching food is aided by a toucan’s 
                    long tongue, which can measure up to 5.9 inches. Aside from gathering food, their infamous beak may all be used to attract potential mates 
                    and scare away predators. Despite the beak’s large appearance, their beaks are light and hollow, aside from a network of bony fibers that 
                    run crisscross through the top for strength and support. It is made of keratine, like human hair and fingernails.
                </p>
               
                <p>
                   <br> A toucan’s colorful feathers provide camouflage in their tropical habitat, where they are able to blend in with the colorful plants 
                   and vegetation. They have short and compact bodies, a rounded tail, and a short, thick neck. Their legs are strong and short. They have small 
                   wings, so they need to flap their wings a lot to fly. To conserve energy, they are more often found sitting in trees than flying.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                   <br> Toucans can be found in Central and South America, high in the rainforest canopies, and they rarely make trips to the forest floor. They 
                   typically create their nests in hollowed-out tree cavities.

                <span class="first-character">F</span> lamingos have slender legs, long, graceful necks, large wings, and short tails. They range from about 90 to 150 cm 
                (3 to 5 feet) tall. There are six species of tall, pink wading birds with thick downturned bills. Flamingos are highly gregarious birds. Flocks numbering 
                in the hundreds may be seen in long, curving flight formations and in wading groups along the shore. On some of East Africa’s large lakes, more than a million 
                lesser flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor) gather during the breeding season. In flight, flamingos present a striking and beautiful sight, with legs and neck 
                stretched out straight, looking like white and rosy crosses with black arms.

               </p>
               <p>
                No less interesting is the flock at rest, with their long necks twisted or coiled 
                upon the body in any conceivable position. Flamingos are often seen standing on one leg. Various reasons for this habit have been suggested, such as regulation 
                of body temperature, conservation of energy, or merely to dry out the legs.
               </p>
               <p>
                To feed, flamingos tramp the shallows, head down and bill underwater, stirring up organic matter with their webbed feet. They eat various types of food, 
                including diatoms, algae, blue-green algae, and invertebrates such as minute mollusks and crustaceans. While the head swings from side to side, food is 
                strained from the muddy water with small comblike structures inside the bill. The bird’s pink colour comes from its food, which contains carotenoid pigments. 
                The diet of flamingos kept in zoos is sometimes supplemented with food colouring to keep their plumage from fading.

                    <span class="first-character">T</span> he Quetzal is a medium-sized bird that is found inhabiting the moist, tropical rainforests of Central America from southern Mexico right down to Panama.
                    There are six sub-species of Quetzal that are found in varying geographic locations including the Crested Quetzal, the Golden-headed Quetzal, the White-tipped Quetzal, the Pavonine Quetzal, the Eared Quetzal, and the most famously known Resplendent Quetzal, all of which belong to the Trogon family of birds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Quetzal is an immensely colored bird with metallic plumage and is widely considered to be one of the most strikingly-beautiful birds in the world. They are most well known for the long tail feathers of the males. The Quetzal is an incredibly colored bird with males displaying a bright metallic green or blue on most of their bodies besides the deep red of the chest and belly. The male Quetzal bird also has a distinctive tuft of golden green feathers that form a crest on top of their heads and immensely long twin tail feathers that can grow up to a meter in length
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Quetzal bird is found throughout the mountainous rainforests of Central America where they tend to prefer high mountain ranges at altitudes of between 4,000 and 10,000 feet. The Quetzal inhabits moist, tropical forests in areas that are cooler, contain dense vegetation, and that is incredibly moist.

                <h5>(Trichoglossus Moluccanus )</h5>

                <span class="first-character">R</span> ainbow lorikeets are a medium sized Australasian member of the parrot family which is found in the rainforest, woodland and bush of Australia and eastern Indonesia. There over 20 sub-species of this bird in Australasia. Rainbow lorikeets live in pairs or small flocks of up to 20 birds although flocks of up to 100 have been recorded. They live and feed on the flowering trees of the forest canopy and like other lorikeets eat mainly nectar pollen, blossoms and seeds. They travel large distances to find food and fiercely defend their feeding and nesting territories.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Rainbow lorikeet gets its name from its bright, multi-coloured plumage. Both sexes have similar colours and the bright orange beak and red eyes.

                Like all parrots lorikeets have the typical curved shape beak necessary for cracking nuts and seeds and the zygodactylous feet (two forward facing toes and two rear facing claws) which allow the birds to perch, climb vertical tree trunks and grasp food in their feet.
               </p>
               <p>
                Rainbow lorikeets form monogamous pairs and both birds are responsible for caring for the young.  Like most parrots they make their nests’ in tree cavities where they lay 3-6 eggs per clutch. The female incubates the eggs which hatch in around 22-24 days. Both parents then care for the young until they fledge at about 70 days old.
